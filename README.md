> <a href="https://maven.apache.org/"><i>Welcome to Apache Maven.</i></a>Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project    object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
>  If you think that Maven could help your project, you can find out more information in the "About Maven" section of the navigation.

Initially, it was developed      by Linus Torvalds, and thus used in the development of the Linux Kernel. The invention is due to the fact that Torvalds was looking for something relatively quick to be able    to handle a constant series of activities related to Linux. Unsuccessful at anything that could be useful, he developed Git. According to the Git Wiki, Git is slang for          "stubborn, always right, quarrelsome".

> The Software Development Kit Manager
> <a href="https://sdkman.io/"><i>SDKMAN!</i></a> is a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple Software Development Kits on most Unix based systems. It provides a          convenient Command Line Interface (CLI) and API for installing, switching, removing and listing Candidates. Formerly known as GVM the Groovy enVironment Manager, it was          inspired by the very useful RVM and rbenv tools, used at large by the Ruby community.

 > <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot"><i>Spring Boot 2.6.2</i></a>Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that     you can "just run".
 >  We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring         configuration.

 > <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html"><i>The Pratical Test Pyramid </i></a>The "Test Pyramid" is a metaphor that tells us to group software         tests into buckets of different granularity. It also gives an idea of how many tests we should have in each of these groups. Although the concept of the Test Pyramid has         been around for a while, teams still struggle to put it into practice properly. This article revisits the original concept of the Test Pyramid and shows how you can put         this into practice. It shows which kinds of tests you should be looking for in the different levels of the pyramid and gives practical examples on how these can be               implemented. 26 February 2018
